# quarkus-mongodb-panache project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

It also shows how easy we can create a microservice manipulating database data very easily as well. 

## Running the application in dev mode

To run a MongoDB session, run the `docker-compose.yml` file from the root of this project 
with the following command:
`docker-compose up`

Then run the Quarkus application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```
